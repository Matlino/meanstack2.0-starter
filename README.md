# meanstack2.0-starter
<h3>Description</h3>
Starter application for web development using Mean stack 2.0 (Mongodb, Express, Angular 2.0, Nodejs). In fact, this is just extended version of angular quickstart (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html), so if you have done that, you should be familiar with angular configuration here. I added nodejs server, simple express router and mongodb. In the app you can also see very basic example of how to access data in your mongodb with angular 2.0. 
Thats it. 
I tried to keep things as simple as possible and did not add any optional packages with two exceptions - nodemon, browser-sync. Those two are not necessary but they can make life of every developer easier. Basically they watch for changes while you are developing so i you save file, page is automatically refreshed and also server is restarted if it is needed.

Angular 2.0 is stil not fully released and new verions are coming out so i will try to keep this project up to date.

2. clone/donwload repository
